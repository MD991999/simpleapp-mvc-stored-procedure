**  TempData

    --TempData is a feature provided by the framework to store data temporarily between two consecutive requests.
    --A key-value collection that allows you to store small amounts of data, such as messages or status information, to be accessed in subsequent requests.
    --For example, if a user submits a form and you want to display a success message on the redirected page, you can store the message in TempData before redirecting and retrieve it in the subsequent request.
    --TempData is meant for short-term storage and is cleared automatically after it is read.



** TempData["InfoMessage"] = "Currently products is not available";
   --here InfoMessage is the key that store the information

** "@" symbol:it is used to indicte the presence of Csharp code

** Razor Syntax:It is used to combine Html Markup with C# code within the same file.

** To auto hide a div ,using a custom script
  --go to script file and create a new folder
  --inside the new file you have to write the code for auto hide.
 eg)   window.setTimeout(() => {
    $(".alert").fadeTo(500, 0).slideUp(500, function () {
        $(this).remove();
    })

}, 4000);

  --After that you have to go to view session from there open the layout.cshtml and inside that drag and drop the newly created custom file on the script session


  **  @Html.ActionLink("Create New Product", "Create", null, new { @class = "btn btn-primary" });

        first argument ==represent the text that should be displayed in the region
        second argument ==represent what should happen when the button is clicked

        forth argument==this is an  anonymous object ,its literally used when u=yu suddenly wnt to add properties to your 


         STANDAD WAY OF CREATING A STOREDPROCEDURE

**   Create procedure SPI_InsertAlldetails(
@ProductName nvarchar(50),
@Price decimal(8,2),
@Qty int,
@Remarks nvarchar(50)
)
AS
begin
Begin try
	begin tran
		Insert Into Tblproductdetails (ProductName,Price,Qty,Remarks)Values
		(@ProductName,@Price,@Qty,@Remarks)
	commit tran
	--commit tran is used to store the changes that we have done in the database into a permanent
End try
begin catch
	rollback tran
	--once we find out that there is an error happened ,then we can bring back all changes that we have commited while doiing this call

	select ERROR_MESSAGE()   ===retrieves the error message associated with the error that occurred and returns it as the result of the stored procedure.
end catch
end

** command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; //execute stored procedure
   command.CommandType = CommandType.Text;  //for executing SQL statements directly 

** FirstOrDefault() :FirstOrDefault() is a LINQ method that is used to retrieve the first element from a sequence or collection that matches a specified condition.
